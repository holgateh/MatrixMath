# MatrixMath
A simple matrix mathematics template library.
Functionality will include the following:
  - Ability to create matrices of arbitrary size.
  - Abliity to create matrices of arbitrary type (type must satisfy certain coniditions like having a valid << overload, and basic arithmetic operations defined).
  - Ability to do arithmetic with matrix objects.
  - Ability to compute determinants of matrix objects (must be square).
  - Ability to compute eigen values of matrix objects (must also be square);
  - Ablitiy to compute eigen vectors and eigen spaces.
  Other:
  - Implement quaternion type.
  - Ability to convert between quaternions and rotational matrices and vice-versa.
